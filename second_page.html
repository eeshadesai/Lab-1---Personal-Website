        <h1><strong>Kathak</strong></h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Kathak</strong> is my favorite hobby and I've been doing it for 9 years now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I just did my graduation over the summer with four other girls
        </p>
        <p>
            Kathak is the dance of storytelling and there are three main types
            <ul>
                <li><em>Jaipur</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>agreesive dance form</li>
                        <li>focuses on footwork</li>
                    </ul>

            For my graduation, we had to perform ten dances, inculuding my solo, and we had a forty minute section with no music that we used to show the footwork and techniques that we learned over the years.
